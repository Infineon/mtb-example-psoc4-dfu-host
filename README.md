# PSoC&trade; 4: Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) host

This example demonstrates how to create an I2C-based DFU Host on [PSoC&trade; 4100S Max Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX/) (`CY8CKIT-041S-MAX`) and flash the PSoC&trade; 4000T target device. 

This code example supports three actions; erase, program, and verify. Also, this project helps to understand how the DFU host works, communicates with the bootloader to update the firmware, and creates a DFU host on a PSoC&trade; 4100S Max Pioneer Kit using the ModusToolbox&trade;.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries must be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command-line tool (*project-creator-cli*). The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command-line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the [PSoC&trade; 4: Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) host](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-dfu-host) application with the desired name "MyDFUHost" configured for the *CY8CKIT-041S-MAX* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-dfu-host --user-app-name MyDFUHost --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).
   
To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal by using the `make modlibs` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool (library-manager-cli) to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CY8CKIT-041S-MAX BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyDFUHost" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyDFUHost" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-041S-MAX
   ```

      **Note:** Modify the TOOLCHAIN variable from the makefile according to your requirement. However, you need to provide the compiler path in the variable named `CY_COMPILER_PATH=` in the makefile.
   </details>


<br>

The DFU host can perform a firmware update on the target only if the DFU target has a compatible bootloader and is in Bootloader mode. If the PSoC&trade; 4000T DFU target device has previously been updated, it will boot to the application every time it is powered up. The device must be switched to bootloader mode by any existing mechanism in the application or by erasing the whole device and re-programming the Bootloader.

Using the user button on the kit, you can either program and verify the firmware application into the target or erase the firmware application from the target.
   
   - Press the user button (single-click) to program and verify the firmware application into the target device.
   - Press and hold the user button for a second to erase the firmware application into the target device.

After programming the firmware image to the target device (PSoC&trade; 4000T), the pin P0.4 of the target device (PSoC&trade; 4000T) toggles at an interval of 500 ms.

The programming status from the DFU host board (i.e., PSoC&trade; 4100S Max Pioneer Kit)  can display the programming status on a serial terminal (i.e., PuTTy), see **Figure 7**.

**Figure 7. Serial output**  

<img src="images/figure_7.png" alt="Figure_7" width="650"/>

You can select the verbose option to print the commands and data that are sent to the target device (PSoC&trade; 4000T) by the PSoC&trade; 4100S Max host. To enable it, set the macro `VERBOSE_PRINT` to **1** in the *cybtldr_api.c* file. 
The UART terminal displays the commands and the data that are sent over I2C, see **Figure 8**.

**Figure 8. Verbose output**  

<img src="images/figure_verbose.png" alt="Figure_7" width="650"/>

By default, the application image present in stringImage.h of this Code Example blinks an LED. The target PSoC&trade; 4000T device Product ID is 0x3614. The application also implements an I2C slave peripheral at address `0x10`. When a particular command is received at this I2C address, the device switches to bootloader mode. This command can be sent to I2C terminal software using an USB bridge or an MCU. The command consists of 3 bytes: `0x01, 0xEA, and 0x17`.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

### Overview

This example demonstrates the basic DFU operations based on the [DFU middleware library](https://github.com/Infineon/dfu).

### DFU host flow

   This section explains how the DFU command response protocol works and how it is used to implement a DFU host on a PSoC&trade; 4100S Max Pioneer Kit.
   
   The DFU process takes place through a series of commands and responses provided by the DFU middleware. **Figure 9** shows the default flow of commands and responses between the host and target during the update process. 
   
   A DFU session always starts with an Enter DFU command from the host to the target. After the target acknowledges the command from the host, the DFU session is established. Commands and responses are exchanged between the host and the target to perform a specified function, such as data transfer and update. A session can be terminated with an Exit DFU command or by a timeout of 10 ms (milliseconds). This timeout resets after each command sent by the host at the host side. 
   
   As shown in **Figure 9**, the host sends the data to the target by using a series of send data commands with data for a single row. A program data command for each row follows this, instructing the device to write a particular row of data into the device memory. Similarly, it can verify and erase the image by sending appropriate commands. 

   **Figure 9. DFU flow**
     
   <img src="images/figure 9_flow.png" alt="Figure_9" width="650"/>

   For more details on the command and response, see Section B of the [AN236282](https://www.infineon.com/AN236282).

   
   ### Application firmware image
   
   To program the target device PSoC&trade; 4000T, the firmware image must be stored in the host MCU. To do so, convert the bootloadable *.cyacd2* file to a string array, where each line (row) will be represented as a string element of the array. Refer to Section 12.1 of [AN236282](https://www.infineon.com/AN236282) for more about the file strucure of cyacd2 file.

   An example of this string array is provided in this code example, which is stored in the *string_Image.h* file located in the source folder *mtb-example-psoc4-dfu-host/source*.
   
   **Note:** Each line inside the *.cyacd2* file is considered one row of data.

   **Figure 10. *string_Image.h* file location**  

   <img src="images/figure_10.png" alt="Figure_10" width="1024"/>

   You can generate this *string_image.h* file from the *.cyacd2* file by copying each line, placing it as a string to form the array, and including it in the *main.c* file. This file is unique for each application, so every time you have to generate or make it separately.


   ### *string_Image.h* file structure

   The structure of your *string_Image.h* file is predefined and needs to be consistent. It must contain a line count as a macro. This helps to identify the total number of lines (elements) present in the array. It must store all the data in the form of a string array, where each line of the *.cyacd2* file represents one element of an array. **Figure 11** shows the structure of the *string_Image.h* file.

   **Figure 11. *string_Image.h* file structure**  
   
   <img src="images/figure_11.png" alt="Figure_11" width="1024"/>


   ### Bootloader host program

   **Figure 12** illustrates a protocol-level diagram of a bootloader host and the target system. The bootloader host and target each have two blocks – the core and the communication layer.

   **Figure 12. Protocol level diagram of bootloading**
     
   <img src="images/figure_12.png" alt="Figure_12" width="1024"/>

   The bootloader target core performs all the bootloading operations. The bootloader host core sends command packets and flash data to the target. Based on the response from the target, it decides whether to continue bootloading.

   The target core decodes the commands from the host, executes them by calling flash routines such as erase row, program row, and verify row, and forms response packets.

   The communication layer on the host and target provide a physical layer to support the bootloading protocols. They contain communication protocol (I2C) specific APIs to perform this function. This layer sends and receives protocol packets between the host and the target.

   
   ### Bootloader host core Files

   **cybtldr_parse.c / .h**

   This module handles the parsing of the *.cyacd2* string array that contains the bootloadable image to send to the device. It also has functions for setting up access to the file, reading the header, reading the row data as well.

   **cybtldr_api.c / .h**

   This is a row-level API file for sending a single row of data at a time to the bootloader target. It has functions for setting up the bootload operation, erasing a row, programming a row, verifying a row, and ending the bootload operation. **Table 1** describes in detail the functions of this API file.

   **Table 1. Functions of cybtldr_api.c /.h**

   Function  |  Description
   :------- | :------------
   CyBtldr_StartBootloadOperation | This function enables the communication interface and sends an Enter Bootloader command to the target.
   CyBtldr_ProgramRow | The host breaks the row data into smaller pieces and sends them to the target using Send Data commands. Along with the last portion of row data, it sends a Program Data command to program the target.
   CyBtldr_VerifyRow | This function breaks the row data into smaller pieces and sends them to the target using Send Data commands. Along with the last portion of row data, it sends a Verify Data command to verify the data present in the target flash.
   CyBtldr_EraseRow | This function sends an Erase Row command to erase a row from the flash row at a given address.
   CyBtldr_EndBootloadOperation | This function sends an Exit Bootloader command and disables the communication interface.
   <br>
   
   **Note:** The buffer size of the bootloader is kept at 64 bytes. Therefore, the host can send only 64 bytes of data at a time to the bootloader. This includes the Start Of Packet (0x01), Command Code (1 byte), Data Length (2 bytes), Checksum (2 bytes), and End Of Packet (0x17), which means each transaction can send only 57 bytes of the actual data from each row. Therefore, each row is broken into smaller pieces and sent using multiple send data commands, as shown in **Figure 9**. The host sends a series of send data commands, followed by program data commands for each line of data. 

   **cybtldr_command.c / .h**

   This API handles the construction of command packets to the target and parses the response packets received from the target. The cybtldr_api.c / .h invokes the functions of this API. For example, to send an Enter Bootload command,
   CyBtldr_StartBootloadOperation() calls the CyBtldr_CreateEnterBootloadCmd() function of this API. It also has a function for calculating the checksum of the command packets before sending them to the target.

   **communication_api.c / .h**

   Host-side API functions for the communication layer are in communication_api.c / .h files. There are four functions – OpenConnection(), CloseConnection(), ReadData(), and WriteData(). They are pointed to by function pointers within the 'CyBtldr_CommunicationsData' structure, defined in cybtldr_api.h.

   You need to define these functions based on their communication layer. This example uses the I2C protocol. Therefore, the I2C-based functions are defined in this project and present in the communication_api.c / .h files. There are four functions – OpenConnection(), CloseConnection(), ReadData(), and 
   WriteData() functions. They are pointed to by function pointers within the 'CyBtldr_CommunicationsData' structure that gets initialized in the *main.c* file.

   **Note:** This project has all the necessary files to create the I2C-based bootloader host on the PSoC&trade; 4 device.

   **Figure 13. Different API files**  
   <img src="images/figure_13.png" alt="Figure_13" width="1024"/>

   ### DFU host interfaces

   The DFU host uses the I2C as the transport to communicate with the target bootloader.
